# Web Application Vulnerabilities Simulation 🕸️

This project showcases common web application vulnerabilities and demonstrates how they can be exploited — and more importantly, how to fix them. Topics include:

- ✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- ✅ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- ✅ Session Hijacking
- ✅ Malicious File Uploads

## 🔍 Attack Scenarios

Realistic demos using vulnerable `.aspx` pages to simulate:

- **Session stealing via XSS and cookie capture**
- **CSRF-based privilege escalation**
- **File upload exploits revealing directory structures**
- **Session impersonation and lateral movement using iframe injection**

## 🔐 Defense Strategies

- Input validation and output encoding
- MIME-type and file size validation
- Cookie security with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) use
- Principle of Least Privilege enforcement

## 📄 Summary

This project demonstrates how web developer tools, insecure coding practices, and poor file validation can be used by attackers — and how organizations can harden their systems with proactive security measures.
